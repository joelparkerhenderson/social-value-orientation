Social value orientation (SVO) is a psychological trait that is defined as an individual’s natural preference with respect to the allocation of resources.

SVO uses three major categories:

* "Pro-self competitor"

  * Wants to maximize the relative difference between their own and others’ outcomes.

  * Approxmiately 1/8 of people.

* "Pro-self individualist" 

  * Wants to maximize their own outcome per the rational actor model.

  * Approximately 1/4 of people.

* "Pro-social cooperator"

  * Wants to maximize the total outcome of the group, and is dedicated to an equal split of resources. 

  * Approximately 1/2 of people.


## Experiment

Social value orientation is measured by tests that have been extensively developed and tweaked over the years.

For example, a test might ask you to choose between options:

* Option A: 480 points for self and 80 points for other

* Option B: 540 points for self and 280 points for other

* Option C: 480 points for self and 480 points for other

For another example, a test might ask you to describe yourself:

* Option A: I like to “win” relative to other people.

* Option B: I like to gain the largest share of resources for myself. 

* Option C: I like to equalize outcomes.

Rubric:

* If you chose Option A then you're a pro-self-competitor.

* If you chose Option B then you're a pro-self-individualist.
 
* If you chose Option C then ou're pro-social-cooperator.


## Aims

The pro-self orientation is most concerned with maximizing one's own outcome. 

A pro-self-competitor aims for one goal:

1. Maximize one's own outcomes, especially maximizing the difference between one's own outcomes and other parties' outcomes.

A pro-self-individualist aims for one goal:

1. Maximize one’s own outcomes, regardless of other parties' outcomes.

The pro-social orientation is most concerned with a belief in social responsibility (such as a concern with others’ outcomes) and reciprocity (such as a concern for equality in outcomes).

A pro-social-cooperator aims for three simultaneous goals: 

1. Maximize one's own outcomes.

2. Maximize joint outcomes.

3. Achieve equality in outcomes.


## Games

People who measure as "cooperators" through an SVO measurement tool display greater actual cooperation in experimental games involving the distribution of resources, such as the prisoner’s dilemma, the ultimatum game, and the dictator game, than people who have been classified as individualists and competitors.

SVO has significant effects on the outcome of such games, directly affecting how resources are divided among participants.

SVO is also correlated with process behaviors, such as the strategic use of fairness in negotiation. 

* For example, pro-self-individuals are tougher and less problem-solving in negotiation settings. 

Researchers have distinguished between true concern for fairness, demonstrated by prosocials, and strategic use of fairness by proselfs.


## Real world

SVO is related to real world behavior. 

Prosocial and proself comparisons:

* Pro-social people donate more to others, especially to the poor and the sick.

* Pro-social people are more likely to take public transportation, and also to link that decision to issues of collective welfare.

* Pro-social people care most about the equality of procedures, while proself people mainly assess their own procedures without regard to others’ experiences.

* Pro-self people have a heightened sensitivity to whether or not they have had a voice in a particular process; this leads to what psychologists call the “egocentric justice hypothesis.”


## Big 5

SVO complements the "Big Five" personality variables in psychology:

* Extraversion
* Agreeableness
* Openness
* Conscientiousness
* Neuroticism 

These "Big Five" personality variables differ greatly between individuals.
